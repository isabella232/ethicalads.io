The advertising industry wants you to believe that ad tracking makes your advertising space more valuable.
This is only true for publishers who don't have a valuable audience already on their site.
We'll talk briefly about how this works,
and point you to some additional resources to learn more.

The advertising practice of [retargeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting) is what it sounds like:

> **Ad retargeting** is a technology that uses cookies and other invasive targeting methods to follow your users across multiple websites.

### How it works

The way retargeting works is:

* The ad network knows the audience of Valuable Publisher (eg. Python web developers)
* Valuable Publisher has ad network javascript on their site, showing them an ad for **$1 CPM**
* the ad network tags a user via cookies or [other intrusive methods](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/under-senate-pressure-verizon-improves-its-supercookie-opt-out) to follow them across the web
* This user goes to a lower quality site (eg. a recipe website)
* The ad network shows a Python ad to the user on the recipe site, paying **$.25 CPM**

**Retargeting is valuable because it allows advertisers to show ads to your audience on cheaper sites.**

### Why it's bad

Retargeting is also why there are so many terrible recipe websites on the internet.
This is due to market mechanisms that balance the pricing of advertising:

* Advertisers want to pay more to reach Python developers than People Who Cook
* If those developers can be retargeted on recipe sites, recipe sites can show Python ads instead of Cooking ads
* This means there are more possible sites for Python ads, lowing the price of each Python ad sold
* This means recipe sites make more money, and Python docs make less money
* This leads to more recipe sites, and less Python documentation

We only work with valuable publishers,
so everyone in the EthicalAds network has very little to gain from working with tracking ad networks.
As we grow our market across the developer community,
we hope to be able to increase revenue for our publishers because their users won't be as easy to retarget.

### What you can do

By user [privacy-preserving ad network](/publishers/) like EthicalAds,
publishers will be able to continue creating value for open source.
You can also use browser extensions like [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) that protect against the basic forms of this tracking.

If we are able to change how the industry works,
the internet will become a better place.
On a long enough time scale, we'll also get better recipe websites :)

*Note: We only linked to sites in this post that don't retarget you.
